QUARTERS IN SETTGEN
---------------------

Introduction:
Every settlement is composed of multiple quarters (not necessarily four).
These represent the administrative divisions of the settlement as were manifest
in late medieval towns and cities of Europe and elsewhere. Quarters tend to
coincide with neighbourhoods and split along ethnic, religious or economic
lines (e.g. the Mughrabi Quarter in Jerusalem, Jodenbreestraat in Amsterdam or
Shoreditch in London).
As a settlement grows, its citizens spill out of its first quarter and into
new quarters. The new quarter may be similar to the first, or it may be made
up of other races or professions. It contains buildings of its own, and, for
the most part, events in the new quarter will not affect the others.
