QUARTERS IN SETTGEN
---------------------

Introduction:
Every settlement is composed of multiple quarters (not necessarily four).
These represent the administrative divisions of the settlement as were manifest
in late medieval towns and cities of Europe and elsewhere. Quarters tend to
coincide with neighbourhoods and split along ethnic, religious or economic
lines (e.g. the Mughrabi Quarter in Jerusalem, Jodenbreestraat in Amsterdam or
Shoreditch in London).
