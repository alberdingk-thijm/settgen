Every settlement is composed of multiple quarters (not necessarily four).
These represent the administrative divisions of the settlement as were manifest
in late medieval towns and cities of Europe and elsewhere. Quarters tend to

lines (e.g. the Mughrabi Quarter in Jerusalem, Jodenbreestraat in Amsterdam or
Shoreditch in London).
As a settlement grows, its citizens spill out of its first quarter and into
new quarters. The new quarter may be similar to the first, or it may be made
up of other races or professions. It contains buildings of its own, and, for
the most part, events in the new quarter will not affect the others.

After the first quarter, new quarters can be built each time the settlement's
population doubles. Hence, settlements will acquire their first few quarters
quickly and then slow over time. There is no limit on the number of quarters
of a particular type, although multiple quarters of the same type will
